# Praciting building little bits of GUI

I learned about [The 7 Tasks](https://eugenkiss.github.io/7guis/tasks/) from Aria and I'm using them as a way to practice primarily javascript (vanilla, jQuery, etc.).

1. Counter
2. Temperature Converter
3. Flight Booker
4. Timer
5. CRUD
6. Circle Drawer
7. Cells

I don't know whether I'll get to or through all of these, but that's part of the fun, no?
